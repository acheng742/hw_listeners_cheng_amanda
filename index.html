		<h1>Meet Kimchi</h1>

		<p>Kimchi is a sweet little girl who came from a litter of 11 puppies. While we aren't sure what breed she is, we know she sure is cute for a mutt! She loves playing with her brother Kalbi, cuddles, and kisses. Since she is still so young and has only recently gotten her vaccination, she's a bit scared of being outside. I'm sure she'll love it once she gets used to it. Check out this cute picture of below!</p>
